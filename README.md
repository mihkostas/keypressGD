# KeypressGD
A workaround for geometry dash globed2 mod,
to open and close voice chat with out the need to press "V" all the time.
it works by emulating the "V" button.

**Usage:**

Run the keypressGD.exe from the keypressGD folder then
launch geometry dash and join a server etc.

Press "Ctrl+s" to start it.

Press "Ctrl+q" and then "v" one time to stop it.

keypressGD is gonna run on the background , you have to close it from the Taskbar when you finish with GD.


**Note:**

Do to the nature of the program emulating a key on the keyboard windows defender may flag it as malicious even if you build the project yourself , so you may need to set all the project executables to "Allow on device".
